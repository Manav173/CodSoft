#Codsoft Projects Repository

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for three completed tasks undertaken as part of the Codsoft projects. Each task involves the development of machine learning models for different purposes. Below is an overview of each task and its respective code and resources:

## Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

Objective: Create a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information. Techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings, along with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines, are employed.


## Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Objective: Build a model for the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions. Leveraging a dataset comprising credit card transaction information, various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests have been experimented with to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.


## Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

Objective: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Utilizing historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics, this task explores algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting for churn prediction.


## Getting Started
Refer to the individual project directories for specific instructions on running the code and reproducing the results for each task.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and build upon these projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
